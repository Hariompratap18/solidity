# Project Title

Token Creation and Deletion (TCD)

## Description

The following code represents a straightforward token contract facilitating the establishment, dissemination, and eradication of a personalized token named "metaverse" (mtv) on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed to be flexible, the contract allows the token supply to be managed by the contract owner or authorized parties, while also enabling seamless token transfers. Its adaptability makes it a strong cornerstone for building more intricate token contracts, including those utilized for ICOs, governance tokens, or other applications entailing customized tokens on the Ethereum network
